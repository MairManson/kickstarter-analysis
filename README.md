# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Client Louise created a $12K US-based
 Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for the play "Fever". Louiseâ€™s play \"Fever\" came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time.
We used Excel to analyze how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
We created pivot tables and charts of the data to deliver easy-to-interpret information at a glance and allow her to quickly view varying scenarios to determine how to create even more successful future crowdfunding campaigns.

### Purpose
Researching projects similar in scope and type for her specific data will help Louise's future project find greater success.
From the data, she can determine that theater is a popular and successful type of campaign overall and
there is a spike of successful campaigns that began in June, but that tapers off by the end of the year.

## Analysis and Challenges
This anaylsis examines how campaign length might be tied to its outcome.  

For example, is a shorter or longer campaign more effective? Is there a certain time of year when campaigns tend to be more successful?

The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We created pivot tables and charts of the data to deliver easy-to-interpret information at a glance and allow her to quickly view varying scenarios to determine how to create even more successful future crowdfunding campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Louise's campaign was for more than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal. Failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
